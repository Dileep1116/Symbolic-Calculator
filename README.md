# Symbolic-Calculator
This is an ongoing project to create a symbolic calculator.

# What can it do?  
## Linear Algebra
* Solve a System of Equations  
Here we solve a system of _n_ linear equations in _n_ unkowns.  
* Find Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors  
Here we find the eigenvalues of a matrix of a given size _n_

## Single Variable Calculus
* Differentiate function f(x)  
Here we take input in the form _d / dx(f(x))_ where _f(x)_ is a function of _x_.
* Plot y = f(x)  
Here we plot a graph from a function of _x_. E.g. _sin(x)_.
